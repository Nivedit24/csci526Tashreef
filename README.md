## CSCI 526: Main Unity Game

### Our game is a 2D platformer where the player must strategically engage with in-game elements of air, water, fire and earth to choose their ability and forge their way to the goal.

- Air ball collectables which the player can collect in order to hover on an air ball. The player can move faster, jump higher while hovering on the air ball. 
- White clouds that push the player up (or down depending on direction of clouds) when the player floats on the air ball.
- Checkpoint stars that the player can collect in order to respawn at the particular checkpoints when it dies.
- Obstacles and Enemies
  - Spikes that damage the player HP on collision.
  - Tornadoes moving in to and fro motion. They damage the player HP on collision.
  - Lightning Clouds which move left and right in back and forth motion and shoot lightning from the air to damage player HP.
- Flag that serves as the destination/goal for the level.
