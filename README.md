In this 2D platformer, players find themselves in a world infused with elemental magic. As the protagonist, you possess a unique ability to harness and control the forces of air, water, earth and fire. Each element grants you specific powers, enabling you to manipulate your environment and overcome formidable obstacles.

Collect the wind power-up to obtain an air ball which can be used to hover over clouds, temporarily giving you the ability to glide and levitate and move faster above ground. With fire, you can shoot obstacles using the fireball ability, giving you an offensive attack and allows you to switch on/off platforms. Water allows you to freeze monsters and terrain objects and manipulate them as platforms to progress through the level. Earth grants you a shield which blocks all damage and inflicts damage to monsters on colliding with them. 

What sets this game apart are the interactions that the player has to make with the in-game elements in order to harness its various abilities. For example, the player can use the ability to fly only by maneuvering its way through the white clouds. As you progress, your mastery over these elements deepens, granting you the ability to combine their powers for more intricate solutions.
